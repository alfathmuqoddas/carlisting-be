# Car Listing API

This is a simple Express.js API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete car listings. It uses SQLite for the database and Sequelize for the ORM.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and npm from the npm website (https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/alfathmuqoddas/carlisting-be.git
cd carlisting-be
npm install
```

## Running the API

To run the API, you can use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the API on port 3000. You can access the API by navigating to http://localhost:3000/api in your web browser.
